# Spatially Distorted Signaling US Wind Infrastructure
This documentation utilizes [U.S. Wind Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LE2V0R) collected by Leah Stokes, Emma Franzblau, Jessica R. Lovering, and Chris Miljanich. We will be exploring the effects of spatially distorted signaling in relation to wind energy infrastructure throughout various regions of the U.S. over time. Using random sampling, within 3 km buffer regions around wind infrastructure, our statistical analysis will examine public opinion and action in response to local climate policies. The role that socioeconomic factors play in relation to minority opinion holders influence on policymakers will additionally be assessed.
